To understand this shell first you have to learn C language, Linux commandline, basic of System Software like Exceptional control flow,signal handling,processes etc.

Makefile	:-Compiles your shell program and runs the tests
README		:-This file
tsh.c		:-This is main file of this tiny shell
tshref		:-The reference shell binary.From which you can compare output of tsh.c(Varify).

# The remaining files are used to test your shell
sdriver.pl :- The trace-driven shell driver
trace*.txt :- The 15 trace files that control the shell driver
tshref.out :- Example output of the reference shell on all 15 traces

# Little C programs that are called by the trace files
myspin.c  :- Takes argument <n> and spins for <n> seconds
mysplit.c :- Forks a child that spins for <n> seconds
mystop.c  :- Spins for <n> seconds and sends SIGTSTP to itself
myint.c   :- Spins for <n> seconds and sends SIGINT to itself
